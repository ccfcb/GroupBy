# GroupBy
Solution to increase customer conversion

## Motivation
With the surge in online shopping due to the recent pandemic, eCommerce businesses are striving to improve their conversion rates through an enhanced understanding of customer journeys and preferences. In this project, the primary objective is to create a solution based on machine learning that can help towards this goal. 

## Our Approach
Our solution includes:

1. Predictive model
The predictive model was developed using eCommerce data available from Kaggle ([Kaggle eCommerce Events History in Cosmetics Shop](https://www.kaggle.com/mkechinov/ecommerce-events-history-in-cosmetics-shop) to pre-train a model. Transfer learning was then used on the pre-trained model to build a final prediction model data supplied by GroupBy.

3. Recommendation system
A recommendation system was built based on collaborative filtering to provide product recommendations using data supplied by GroupBy.

5. Customer classifier
The GroupBy data was used to classify customers into clusters to provide insights about customer behavior.

## Model Deployment
A web application was built using Flask and then the model was deployed in AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
