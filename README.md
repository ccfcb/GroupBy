Solution to increase customer conversion

## Motivation
With the surge in online shopping due to the recent pandemic, the requirements of online shopping platforms to be both user friendly and accurate for predictive inventory and stocking applications has become significant. In this project, the primary objective is to improve the predictive effectiveness of the online shopping experience.
GroupBy has hypothesised that if the probability of the customer conversion is less than 0.2, they will not buy and if it is more than 0.8, their journey is likely to lead to a purchase. The aim of this project is therefore to personalize the shopping experience for customers for whom the conversion probability lies in the range [0.2-0.8].
